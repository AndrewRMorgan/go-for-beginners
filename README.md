# Go For Beginners

Go For Beginners (www.goforbeginners) aims to help beginners learn the programming language Go using interactive exercises and the latest insights from educational research. While primarily built for the teaching of Go, much of the software that runs the interactive exercises is fully open-source and language-agnostic, meaning it can be used to teach a number of other programming languages.
